## codex_prepare_run

Input:
- `workspaceId: string`
- `userGoal: string`
- `focusPaths?: string[]`
- `mode?: "plan" | "refresh" | "repair" | "review"`

Returns structured content:
- `runId`
- `objective`
- `assistantBrief`
- `constraints`
- `plan`
- `currentStep`
- `recommendedNextAction`
- `recommendedTool`

  - `patchEditThreshold`, `deleteRequiresApproval`, `sensitivePathRequiresApproval`, `outsideFocusRequiresApproval`, `extraSafeMakeTargets`, `focusPaths`

## get_workspace_summary

Input:
- `workspaceId: string`
- `focusPaths?: string[]`

Returns:
- root info
- detected language/tooling
- dirty files
- likely commands
- relevant paths

## read_file

Input:
- `runId`
- `path`
- `startLine?`
- `endLine?`
- `purpose?`

Returns:
- file content
- range metadata
- updated run state summary

## git_status

Input:
- `runId`

Returns:
- branch
- dirty files
- untracked files
- ahead/behind if available

## search_code

Input:

## apply_patch

Input:
- `runId`
- `edits[]`

Each edit:
- `path`
- `operation`
- `startLine?`
- `endLine?`
- `oldText?`
- `newText`
- `anchorText?`
- `reason`

### Approval policy

Before applying the patch, a deterministic policy is evaluated using the run's effective `RunPolicy` (Milestone 8).
The patch is gated (approval required) if any of the following hold:
- Any edit has `operation: "delete"` (file deletion) and `deleteRequiresApproval` is `true`
- More than `patchEditThreshold` edits in a single request (default: 5)
- Any path matches a sensitive pattern (`.env`, `.ssh`, `.git/`, `id_rsa`, etc.) and `sensitivePathRequiresApproval` is `true`
- Any path is outside the run's declared `focusPaths` (when non-empty) and `outsideFocusRequiresApproval` is `true`

If approval is required, the result includes `approvalRequired` with the
pending approval details and the patch is **not** applied.

### Returns

- `changedFiles` — list of affected file paths (empty if approval required)
- `diffStats` — summary of additions/deletions (empty if approval required)
- `approvalRequired?` — pending approval object if the patch was gated
- updated run-state summary

## run_tests

Execute a whitelisted test command in the workspace.

### Input

- `runId`: string — Run ID from codex_prepare_run
- `scope`: string — **Semantic test scope**. Accepted values:
  - **Framework names** (explicit): `"cargo"`, `"npm"`, `"pytest"`, `"make"`
  - **Semantic labels** (auto-resolved): `"unit"`, `"integration"`, `"all"`
- `target?`: string — Specific test target (e.g., test name, file path)
- `reason`: string — Why tests are being run (required for audit trail)

### Scope Resolution

1. If `scope` is a framework name, use it directly
2. If `scope` is a semantic label, detect framework via workspace files:
   - `Cargo.toml` exists → "cargo"
   - `package.json` exists → "npm"
   - `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` exists → "pytest"
   - `Makefile` exists → "make"
3. If no framework detected, return error

### Validation

- `scope` must be non-empty and a supported value
- `reason` must be non-empty (for audit trail)
- Scope matching is case-insensitive

### Returns

- `resolvedCommand`: string — The actual command that was executed (empty if approval required)
- `exitCode`: number — Exit code from the test command (-1 if approval required)
- `stdout`: string — Standard output (truncated to 4096 chars)
- `stderr`: string — Standard error (truncated to 4096 chars)
- `summary`: string — Human-readable summary of results
- `approvalRequired?` — Pending approval object if the test was gated

### Approval policy

Before running the test, a deterministic policy is evaluated using the run's effective `RunPolicy` (Milestone 8).
The test is gated (approval required) if:
- `scope` is `"make"` and `target` is not a standard safe target
  (`test`, `check`, `lint`, `build`, `clean`, `all`, `verify`, `fmt`, `format`)
  and not in the run's `extraSafeMakeTargets` list

If approval is required, the result includes `approvalRequired` with the
pending approval details and the test is **not** executed.

### Errors

- Returns error for unsupported scope values
- Returns error if workspace framework cannot be auto-detected
- Returns error if test command fails to execute

## show_diff

Input:
- `runId`
- `paths?: string[]`
- `format?: "summary" | "patch"`

Returns:
- changed files
- diff summary
- optionally patch text
- updated run-state summary

## refresh_run_state

Refresh and return the current run state snapshot.  This is a read-only
operation: it does not trigger actions or perform LLM reasoning.

### Input

- `runId`: string — Run ID from codex_prepare_run

### Returns

- `runId`
- `status` — one of `prepared`, `active`, `blocked`, `awaiting_approval`, `done`, `failed`
- `currentStep`
- `completedSteps`
- `pendingSteps`
- `lastAction`
- `lastObservation`
- `recommendedNextAction`
- `recommendedTool`
- `pendingApprovals` — list of pending approval objects
- `latestDiffSummary`
- `latestTestResult`
- `retryableAction?` — retryable action metadata (Milestone 6), including:
  - `kind` — `"patch.apply"` or `"tests.run"`
  - `summary` — human-readable description
  - `isValid` — whether retry is still valid
  - `isRecommended` — whether retry is the recommended next step
  - `invalidationReason?` — why the action is no longer valid
  - `recommendedTool` — MCP tool to invoke for retry
- `effectivePolicy` (Milestone 8) — the active `RunPolicy` for this run
- `warnings`

### Behavior

- Merges persisted state with live workspace facts (e.g. current git diff)
- Surfaces retryable action metadata for resumption guidance
- Warns if a retryable action is stale or invalidated
- Does not mutate state or trigger any actions
- Does not call any LLM

## replan_run

Deterministically replan the run based on new evidence or failure context.

### Input

- `runId`: string — Run ID from codex_prepare_run
- `reason`: string — Why the run needs replanning
- `newEvidence?: string[]` — New evidence or observations
- `failureContext?: string` — Error or failure context that triggered replanning

### Returns

- `runId`
- `status`
- `currentStep`
- `pendingSteps`
- `recommendedNextAction`
- `recommendedTool`
- `replanSummary`
- `retryableAction?` — retryable action state after replanning (Milestone 6)
- `replanDelta?` — concise description of what changed during replanning (Milestone 6)

### Behavior

- Rule-based replanning only — no LLM calls
- If failure context is provided, inserts a recovery step and invalidates
  any stale retryable action
- If no failure context, preserves valid retryable actions
- Updates recommended next action and tool based on pending steps
- Emits a concise `replanDelta` describing what changed
- Persists updated state to SQLite

## approve_action

Resolve a pending approval (approve or deny a risky action).

### Input

- `runId`: string — Run ID from codex_prepare_run
- `approvalId`: string — Approval ID to resolve
- `decision`: `"approve"` | `"deny"`
- `reason?: string` — Reason for the decision

### Returns

- `approvalId`
- `runId`
- `decision`
- `status` — resulting run status after resolution
- `summary`
- `recommendedNextAction?` — suggested next step after resolution
- `recommendedTool?` — suggested MCP tool after resolution
- `retryableAction?` — retryable action state after the decision (Milestone 6)

### Behavior

- `"approve"` unblocks the run if no more pending approvals remain
  - If a valid retryable action exists, marks it recommended and points
    `recommendedTool` at the action's tool (e.g. `apply_patch`, `run_tests`)
  - If the retryable action is stale, recommends replanning instead
  - The action is never auto-retried — ChatGPT must invoke the next tool
- `"deny"` blocks the run
  - Invalidates the retryable action so it is no longer recommended
  - Recommends replanning via `replan_run`
- Multiple pending approvals are handled predictably: each is resolved independently
- Persists decision to SQLite
- Does not trigger any autonomous continuation

## finalize_run (Milestone 10)

Explicitly close a run with a structured outcome record.

### Input

- `runId`: string — Run ID from `codex_prepare_run`
- `outcomeKind`: `"completed"` | `"failed"` | `"abandoned"` — final disposition

- `status` — new run status, e.g. `"finalized:completed"`
- `recommendedNextAction` — deterministic guidance (no autonomous action taken)

### Behavior

- Exactly one finalization per run — repeated calls are rejected
- `outcomeKind` must be `completed`, `failed`, or `abandoned`; other values are rejected
- Sets `RunState.status` to `"finalized:<outcomeKind>"`
- Persists a `RunOutcome` record in SQLite with `outcomeKind`, `summary`, `reason?`, `finalizedAt`
- Appends a `run_finalized` audit trail entry
- Returns deterministic `recommendedNextAction` guidance based on the outcome kind
- Does **not** trigger any autonomous follow-up work
- Closed runs expose `finalizedOutcome` in `get_run_state`, `refresh_run_state`, and `list_runs`

## reopen_run (Milestone 11)

Reopen a previously finalized run for deterministic continuation.

### Input

- `runId`: string — Run ID of the finalized run to reopen
- `reason`: string — human-readable reason for reopening (required, 1–500 chars)

### Returns

- `runId`
- `status` — `"active"` after a successful reopen

- `recommendedTool` — always `"refresh_run_state"`

### Behavior

- Only finalized runs (`finalized:completed`, `finalized:failed`, `finalized:abandoned`) may be reopened
- Active, prepared, or awaiting-approval runs cannot be reopened — the call is rejected
- Reopening transitions status back to `"active"` and clears `finalizedOutcome`
- Persists compact `ReopenMetadata` in SQLite: `reason`, `reopenedAt`, `reopenedFromOutcomeKind`, `reopenCount`
- `reopenCount` increments on each successive reopen
- Appends a `run_reopened` audit trail entry
- Does **not** execute work or trigger any autonomous follow-up
- Prior plan, completed steps, and audit history are preserved
- Reopen metadata is visible in `get_run_state`, `refresh_run_state`, and `list_runs`

## supersede_run (Milestone 12)

Create a new successor run that explicitly replaces a finalized run with preserved lineage.

### Input

- `runId`: string — Run ID of the finalized run to supersede (must be `finalized:completed`, `finalized:failed`, or `finalized:abandoned`)
- `newUserGoal`: string (optional, max 500 chars) — goal for the successor run; if omitted, the original run's goal is inherited
- `reason`: string — human-readable reason for supersession (required, 1–500 chars)

### Returns

- `originalRunId` — the run ID that was superseded
- `successorRunId` — the newly created successor run ID
- `supersededAt` — ISO 8601 timestamp of supersession
- `successorStatus` — always `"prepared"`
- `recommendedNextAction` — deterministic guidance string
- `recommendedTool` — always `"refresh_run_state"`

### Behavior

- Only finalized runs may be superseded; active, prepared, or awaiting-approval runs are rejected deterministically
- Supersession creates a **new** run in `"prepared"` status — it does **not** reactivate the original run
- The original run remains finalized with its full history, plan, and outcome preserved
- The original run is marked with `supersededByRunId` pointing to the successor
- The successor run is created with `supersedesRunId` pointing to the original
- Both runs carry the same `supersessionReason` and `supersededAt` timestamp
- The successor inherits workspace, focus paths, and policy profile from the original
- The successor starts with an **empty plan** (a clean slate for ChatGPT to replan)
- Appends `run_superseded` audit entry to the original run
- Appends `run_created_from_supersession` audit entry to the successor run
- Does **not** execute work or trigger any autonomous follow-up
- Lineage is visible in `get_run_state` and `list_runs`
